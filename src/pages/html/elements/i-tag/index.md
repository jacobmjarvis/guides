## I Tag

The '<i>' tag defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content of the <i> tag is usually displayed in italic.

The '<i>' tag can be used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, or a ship name, etc.

Use the '<i>' element only when there is not a more appropriate semantic element, such as:

- '<em>' (emphasized text)
- '<strong>' (important text)
- '<mark>' (marked/highlighted text)
- '<cite>' (the title of a work)
- '<dfn>' (a definition term)


### Example
```
<p>He named his car <i>The lightning</i>, because it was very fast.</p>
```
